* make-audiobook

This project provides a Bash script to convert text files into audiobooks using Piper TTS, with support for batch processing and ID3 tagging.

** Features
- Converts one or more text files to MP3 audiobooks using Piper TTS
- Supports batch processing
- Optionally add ID3 metadata (author, book title, track number)
- Selects voices interactively or randomly

** Requirements
- Piper TTS (https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)
- ffmpeg
- pandoc
- fzf (for interactive voice selection)

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./make-audiobook [OPTIONS] TEXT_FILE [TEXT_FILE2 ...]
#+END_SRC

** Options
- -u, --update-voices :: Update installed Piper voices
- -r, --random-voice :: Use a random voice for each file

** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./make-audiobook -r mybook-chapter1.txt mybook-chapter2.txt
# or
./make-audiobook mybook-chapter*.txt
# or
./make-audiobook --random-voice mybook.epub
# or use a docx, odt, markdown, any format supported by pandoc can be used
#+END_SRC

** Voice Setup
On first run, if no Piper voices are found, the script will prompt you to run `piper-voices-setup` to download voices.

** Metadata
You will be prompted for author and book title. These will be added as ID3 tags to the output MP3 files.

** Compatibility Notes
- Uses `find` instead of `fd` for voice discovery
- Avoids Bash 4+ features for macOS compatibility
